# Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to explore further New York City's CitiBike program to allow potential investors to visualize what a similar program may look like in Des Moines, Iowa. 


## Results

This visualization reveals that most people check out after the first 20 minutes of the ride. There are many possible explanations for why this may be the case, but this short ride period might indicate to investors that more bikes are needed to meet the demand of quantity.

There is not a significant difference between males and females for checkout times, but there are many more male than female riders.

This visualization shows that on the weekdays, the most bike trips occurs between 8 and 9am and 5 and 6pm, which are typically commuting hours. On the weekend, however, trips are taken more spread throughout the day.

This simple pie chart reveals that there are many more males than females (and unknown) in the dataset. This likely explains the visualizations that appear to show many more male than female riders.

The first image shows a heatmap of male bike riders, and the second image shows a heatmap of female bike riders. There are common trends between the two visualizations, but it seems that females take bike rides on Saturdays slightly more than males.

This pie chart shows the amount of customers versus subscribers; in the image, we can see that about 80% of the people in the dataset are subscribers, where the remaining are simply customers.

When breaking down the number of rides by user type, it is evident that male subscribers take significantly more rides than other groups. In general, this makes sense as the two groups that make up most of the dataset are subscribers and males. It might be interesting to see a dataset that is more equal among gender and user type to see if there are true discrepancies.


## Summary

The main takeaways from this analysis is that most bike rides are only upward of 20 minutes long, most rides are taken at typical commuting hours during the work week and at all hours throughout the morining/afternoon on the weekends, and male subscribers make up most of the rides.

It would be interesting to explore further the bike riders who commute to work, since this is when most of the trips happen. Observing the starting and ending location of these trips might provide some useful insight to where most bike trips take place throughout the city. Another visualization that I would be interested in seeing is a trip breakdown by age; are there certain ages of riders that are more prevalent than others?
